# SB_ActiveSwap

Allow to iterate active object over selected with shortcuts (shift+\`: next, ctrl+shift+\` : prev)

> /!\ DEV VERSION, work only for object mode selection

---

### Description

press 'shift+\`', next object in selection become active
press ctrl+shift+\`, previous object in selection become active

Shortcut are for qwerty layout (since the '\`' key is easily accessible to the left hand with modifier pressed)
You must change it in source code if you are on azerty.
If I finish it someday I'll post a version with valid shortcut for french keyboard


### TODO:
- Active vertex swapping in Edit mode
- Active bone swapping in Armature mode
- add a deselect shortcut to deselect active
